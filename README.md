# OpenScreenLapser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tybantarnusa/openscreenlapser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tybantarnusa/openscreenlapser)

OpenScreenLapser is a software to make timelapse video of your screen written in Python. It works by taking screenshots of your screen at any defined time intervals automatically then combine them into one video.

OpenScreenLapser uses pyscreenshot (which depends to other modules) to take screenshots and ffmpeg to create the video.

This project is currently in progress so it may not work as intended for the time being.
